ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Brian Hulette, some facts about me:
- `TheNeuralBit` is an [anagram](https://theneuralbit.com/anagranimation.html) of my name.
- I'm currently a software engineer at Google, primarily working on [Apache Beam](https://github.com/apache/beam).
- I like to make things, both digital and physical, and sometimes I write about them at [theneuralbit.com](https://theneuralbit.com).
